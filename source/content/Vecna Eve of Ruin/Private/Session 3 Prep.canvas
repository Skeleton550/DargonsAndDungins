It has geography very similar to Neverwinter however the sun isn't shining and an ashen-laden fog rises from lava flowing through the city choking it. In the distance there is a populated market but instead of Humans, elves, dwarfs and so on, it is only occupied by various forms of undead.","x":-100,"y":-320,"width":460,"height":360},

The ruins are long destroyed and mostly rubble and are large with most places inaccessible from fallen debris. Long dead skeletons scatter the ruins with rusted weapons and worn cloth barely hanging onto their bones. At the centre of the tower stands a strangely clean and well kept tower with grey rings half way and three quarters up.\n\nFerros (hopefully) Investigates\n\nYou approach this tower and begin investigating it. It stands about 30ft tall and is made from a cold black stone. At the bottom of the obelisk lays many more skeletons except the bones on these seem to be melting into each other and merging into a bone puddle at the base of the tower. Intricate green details are etched into the black object, they seem to be some sort of language or cypher that you can't discern. \n\nWhile investigating this object the grey rings and green etchings begin to glow and a spout of green magic shoots out of the top of the object. A pulse knocks back the Warforged and green tentacles latches out of the top wrapping itself around him. It worms inside his head and the Warforged goes limp and begins to fade away...","x":-1100,"y":-320,"width":500,"height":760},

At that time, the populace viewed Lord Neverember as a manipulative tyrant.

The Dolindar tomb is in Evernight’s graveyard, and Sangora provides true directions to it.\n\n**Dolindars.** Sangora explains that the Dolindar family was exiled to the Shadowfell for reasons they never shared.

This will be used to fight Vecna and strip him of Godhood. Even more unfortunate for you, we cannot assist in this journey and we can merely just point you in the right direction and help wherever we can.
