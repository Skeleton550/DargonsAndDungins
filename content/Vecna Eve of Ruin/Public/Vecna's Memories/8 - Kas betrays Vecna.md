The players see the Lich and the Vampire Lieutenant in a room. The lich is facing away from the vampire but is aware of his presence. They're having a tense and awkward discussion about future battle plans for the next city invasion. The vampire holds the sword gifted to him up to his ear and listens for a small moment. He then swings the sword at the Lich. The Lich locks the sword in the air with a spell and with a disappointed look on his face blasts the vampire back and through the walls of the castle. They fight on for hours, the Vampire landing strikes and the Lich returning them with high level spells. The vampire then swings is sword up and the lich holds up his arm to block the attack from hitting his head. The sword slices through the Liches hand and it comes clean off. He ready's his sword for another strike this one impaling the Lich through the eye killing him. With the last of his breath the Lich sends the Vampire flying through a rift he created never to be seen again dropping his sword as he's flung back. The Liches body turns to ash and disintegrates leaving nothing behind but the Vampires gifted sword and the hand and eye of a once friend. 

Alongside the Vampire, you, too are flung into the rift and begin falling through space and time. After a while you appear in a random place in space and time. The place is just purple and black mist for as far as the eye can see. In front of you is a pedestal with an item on top of it. The item looks different for all of you. The items are shrouded in shadow but you can make out a loose shape of the items

Neon sees a rod with something indistinguishable on top of it.
Rix sees a circular shaped object with indistinguishable designs on each side of the flat circle
Varin sees an amulet with a medallion in the centre that you can't quite make out

Upon touching you items the shadowy mist is cleansed from the items

Neon - Rod of the Pact Keeper+2
Rix - Coin of Tyche
Varin - Amulet of the Devout +2
Bartholamew - Musket +2
