You started with the aftermath of the fight with the Lord of Blades, noticing that Mercy had mysteriously disappeared. After a rest you, headed towards an ominous green glow in the mountaintops of Khorvaire. Upon reaching the source of the glow, you ran into Arkhan the Cruel, the current wielder of the Hand of Vecna. Lots of fighting later, Arkhan fell and you came into possession of the hand of Vecna. You then headed back to Sigil and the sanctum where you reported the events to the Wizards Three. The next day Alustriel had the portal ready where you were heading to a dark unknown misty place. 

After stepping through the portal you were greeted by a very angry mob of peasants. You then all defused the situation and explained to the commoners that you meant no harm, shortly after, they let you go. You were then approached by Sarusandra who was happy to give you the next piece of the rod of seven parts, as long as you help here stop the cultists inside Death House as well as the Ulmist Inquisition.
