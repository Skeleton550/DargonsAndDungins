The session started with Ferros exploring some ruins in a distant world before approaching a strange obelisk and getting disintegrated, re-appearing with the rest of the party in the Shadowfell equivalent of Neverwinter, Evernight

Varin confronted Neon about him pretending to be a Cleric when he is actually a warlock then the party set off to the corpse market. Neon soon after dismissed his disguise and was revealed to be a blue tiefling with ram style horns with ornaments and medallions decorating his clothes and body.

They were told by a woman called Sangora that she knew the location of a crevice of dusk that would allow the party to escape. She would give this information to players in exchange for a bit of information. 

Upon reaching the Dolindar Tomb, where the crevice of dusk was located, you got ambushed by 4 vampire spawn that Sangora told about you in good faith that they would keep an eye on the party and help them if they needed help, instead the vampires tried to make a meal out of you.

You entered the tomb and came across Newmy a ghost that cleaned the tombs for the dead Dolindars however she hadn't cleaned beyond the entrance as the Dolindars "Weren't resting properly" 

Upon entering the next room you fought of 2 Lost Sorrowsworn made from the corpses of the siblings in the Dolindar family

You then came across a room with a puzzle in that Rix then quickly figured out opening the room. In this room there was a lonely sorrowsworn manifested from the Dolindar Matron who attacked the players on sight. After defeating her, in the coffin was the Crevice of Dusk allowing the players to get back to Neverwinter.

Once back in Neverwinter you reported back to Neverember who rewarded you with a house each and the Noble families of the people you rescued gave you 9000gp to share. Rix and Indrina confronted Neverember about being a fraud who tried to have them arrested before Laerel Silverhand stopped Neverember imprisoning him for faking his nobility.

You then had a party with everyone which was rudely interrupted Vecnan cultists invading the city. A voice then stopped you and summoned a portal in front of you which Laerel Silverhand urged you to go into.

Upon walking through the portal you found yourself in Sigil, The city of doors and followed a line of dead Vecnan cultists to a plaza. In this plaza was The Lady of Pain dead and being hung by magic chains.

Further following the corpses you found a secret wall that headed into a sanctum where Alustriel Silverhand, Tasha and Mordenkainen were fighting the remaining Vecnan cultists. After killing them they introduced themselves and attempted to cast a greater wish spell that failed due to Vecna's power. Mordenkainen then came up with the backup plan with the Rod of Ultimate Law and the chime of exile. They then researched the first place of the Rod and sent you on your way
