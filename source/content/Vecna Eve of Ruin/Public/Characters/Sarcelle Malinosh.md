Sarcelle Malinosh is a human wild-magic sorcerer who plumbs the mysteries of the Outer Planes.

Glimmer rudely awoke Sarcelle in her prison cell when the players found her. Upon meeting the players she expressed worry about the recent loss of her spellcasting powers as she was unable to defend herself. 

> *"I would appreciate an escort out of this hellish place, preferably not the flea infested feline over there, as I no longer have my powers to defend myself"*

## Sarcelle's Secret
After a small questioning from [[Rix]] players Sarcelle told the players that her psychic explorations showed her a glimpse of a dreadful future. She saw a desiccated figure of a man levitating off the ground, gathering evil energy around himself in glowing wisps. The desiccated man then screamed and the energy exploded, causing something terrible to happen.
