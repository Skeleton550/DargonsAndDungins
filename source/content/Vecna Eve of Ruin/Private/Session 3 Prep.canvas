The inhabitant is Gertrude, a chaotic neutral cyclops who was the lone survivor of an attack on a supply caravan near the ruins of the city of Ched Nasad. Makubli (see area W2) captured Gertrude weeks ago and brought her here as a prisoner, hoping she would reveal information about Blingdenstone’s interest in Ched Nasad. Gertrude is a caravan guard and has no information the cultists can use; as soon as they realize this, they’ll kill Gertrude, and she knows it. Her prized +2 Greatclub is stashed in the chest in area W6.\n\nRecruiting Gertrude. Gertrude hates Lolth and is eager to escape Web’s Edge. If she realizes the characters are infiltrators, she begs them to free her. In exchange for her freedom, Gertrude offers to help the characters, including giving them her greatclub from the chest in area W6.\n\nGertrude’s Secret. Even if the characters free her, Gertrude remains despondent. If the characters ask her what’s wrong, Gertrude reveals that her friend, a svirfneblin named Rockzanna, was involved in a nearby mining operation and discovered that two of the operation’s leaders were secret Lolth cultists planning an attack on the operation. Rockzanna was too scared to tell anyone besides Gertrude, and the cyclops fears a terrible fate for the miners.\n\nRegardless of the characters’ reaction to this revelation, learning it counts for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book’s introduction. The mining operation is the same one the cultists in area W7 are discussing.\n\n\n","x":4320,"y":4240,"width":740,"height":660},

Near that creature stands a smaller, one-eyed creature with a body that resembles melting wax.*\n\nThis cavern’s ceilings are 50 feet tall. The cavern is the lair of Ker-arach, the spiderdragon (see appendix A). Ker-arach crawled into this cavern through a temporary rift to the Abyss that opened during a ritual conducted here about half a year ago. Ker-arach brought with her a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, which she uses to answer questions posed directly to the Spider Queen. Ker-arach is essentially a tourist attraction for the few Lolth devotees who know she exists. The cultists consider her a sign of Lolth’s favour, even though she eats hundreds of pounds of meat every few days and doesn’t otherwise contribute to the complex.\n\n\nKer-arach’s Web. The web in the center of the cavern is made of ultra-strong, ultra-sticky strands of Ker-arach’s silk. Additionally, Ker-arach has spun other, smaller webs throughout the area. The webs are difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the webbing for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or it becomes stuck and has the restrained condition. As an action, a creature can try to pull itself or another creature within its reach from the webbing, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature freed in this way is no longer restrained by the webbing.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away, dealing 5 (2d4) fire damage to any creature in that area.\n\nRetrieving the Rod Piece. The first piece of the Rod of Seven Parts is wrapped tightly in silk at the center of this cavern’s web. Characters who have darkvision or a light source can see the rod piece from up to 30 feet away. A character within reach of the rod piece can use a sharp tool to cut it free of the web as an action.
