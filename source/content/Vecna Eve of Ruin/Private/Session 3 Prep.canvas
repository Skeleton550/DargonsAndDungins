In the distance you see a forlorn metropolis. It has geography very similar to Neverwinter however the sun isn't shining and an ashen-laden fog rises from lava flowing through the city choking it. In the distance there is a populated market but instead of Humans, elves, dwarfs and so on, it is only occupied by various forms of undead."},

The ruins are long destroyed and mostly rubble and are large with most places inaccessible from fallen debris. Long dead skeletons scatter the ruins with rusted weapons and worn cloth barely hanging onto their bones. At the centre of the tower stands a strangely clean and well kept tower with grey rings half way and three quarters up.\n\nFerros (hopefully) Investigates\n\nYou approach this tower and begin investigating it. It stands about 30ft tall and is made from a cold black stone. At the bottom of the obelisk lays many more skeletons except the bones on these seem to be melting into each other and merging into a bone puddle at the base of the tower. Intricate green details are etched into the black object, they seem to be some sort of language or cypher that you can't discern. \n\nWhile investigating this object the grey rings and green etchings begin to glow and a spout of green magic shoots out of the top of the object. A pulse knocks back the Warforged and green tentacles latches out of the top wrapping itself around him. It worms inside his head and the Warforged goes limp and begins to fade away..."},

I don’t know if the cultists planned to send us here, but here we are. Neverwinter has cracks between our world and the Shadowfell—Crevices of Dusk, they’re called. Planar travelers sometimes slip through.*\n> \n> *“We’re in a nasty city called Evernight. It’s an evil echo of Neverwinter, populated by undead. We arrived in Evernight’s graveyard because we left from Neverwinter’s graveyard.*\n> \n> *“There’s no evidence of the crevice we came through. It doesn’t surprise me that it’s gone; stable crevices are rarer than spontaneous ones. But we need a stable one to get back to Neverwinter.*\n> \n> *“We shouldn’t spend a lot of time traipsing through an undead-infested metropolis, hoping to stumble across a gateway to Neverwinter. That feels unsafe. Maybe we should ask around inconspicuously. There’s a market east of the Neverwinter Graveyard, which means it’s likely there’s a market east of Evernight’s graveyard, too. But we should be careful.”*"},

Tattered canvas and shrouds separate the numerous stalls. Feeble moonlight and flickering torches illuminate the city, regardless of the time of day.*\n\n#### The Market’s Goods\n\nGoods for sale in the Corpse Market include ghoulish remains intended for consumption, such as fingers pickled in brine, jars of blood, and wrapped organs. Shops sell bouquets of dead flowers, frayed burial finery, jewellery displayed on severed hands, elegant canopic jars, and the like.\n\nYou receive sidelong stares from merchants and customers but they all stray far away under the impression that your not here by accident."},

You’re not likely interested in a cup of warm blood, but perhaps you need something else? Something more ephemeral, like directions? Or knowledge? I’ve been in this city a long, long time.”* - Sangora\n\nSangora can sell information to the players at a price of 20gp per piece of info or she will charge nothing if the players answer her pressing questions\n\nSangora can share the following points:\n\n**Evernight.** Sangora provides background about the city of Evernight, as presented above.\n\n**Neverwinter.** Sangora hasn’t been to Neverwinter in more than a decade and remembers the place as a lawless ruin. At that time, the populace viewed Lord Neverember as a manipulative tyrant. Sangora knows that gateways called Crevices of Dusk occasionally appear in Evernight and allow passage to and from Neverwinter.\n\n**Crevices of Dusk.** Sangora explains that residents of both Evernight and Neverwinter dislike these portals being used indiscriminately. Those who know the location of stable Crevices of Dusk either guard or hide them.\n\n**Stable Crevice of Dusk.** Sangora tilts her head with a thoughtful look before revealing that she knows of a stable Crevice of Dusk in a tomb of one of Evernight’s former living families, the Dolindars. The Dolindar tomb is in Evernight’s graveyard, and Sangora provides true directions to it.\n\n**Dolindars.** Sangora explains that the Dolindar family was exiled to the Shadowfell for reasons they never shared. The family studied wizardry and knew much about planar gates despite being unable to use them due to a family curse. They were miserable and lonely in life."}
