The players watch as the same half elf this time old and dying climbs a steep rock face. Upon reaching the top of this rock face he collapses to his knees in exhaustion. In front of him is a giant crater.  The old man begins chanting an unknown language. The crater is unknowingly deep and a rumbling begins to shake the earth. You watch as rising out of the ground a gargantuan snake like creature rises from the depths of the crater. It has a stone grey skin and two piercing eyes fluctuating in colour. There is a single slit along the bottom half of its head for its mouth. It begins speaking back to the old man in the same language. After a while the serpent stops speaking as does the half elf. The man stands up bracing himself on his staff. The snake like creature looks into the sky and opens its mouth. Its eyes turn a undead green and a massive beam of energy shoots out of the serpents mouth into the skies. Green lightning begins striking around the man and 1 final consistent lightning bolt strikes the man. He screams in agony as the lightning bolt funnels energy into the man.

It eventually finishes with an explosion of green necrotic energy and emerging from the explosion is the same man. However this time not held back by his old feeble body
