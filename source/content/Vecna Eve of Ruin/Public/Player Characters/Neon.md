Neon is a secretive Lathander Cleric that helped the players rescue the prisoners from the Vecnan cult. He claims to have shut down the rising Ashmadai cult of Asmodeus in Neverwinter by passing on information to the town guard. Remembering Neon, the guard decide to hire him for the operation to rescue the 4 kidnapped citizens. 

Before getting banished into the Shadowfell [[Vecna]] insulted each of the players but none of his insults fit Neon's description.
