The players walk through the rift and are confronted by a city burning and the same two men talking to another injured man on his knees. They approach and yet again they can't see you. The kneeling man pleads

> *"Please don't kill anyone else I'm begging you. I'll surrender myself and my family to you if you stop slaughtering my people"*

> *"That's a deal I can work with. Lieutenant! Gather the remaining survivors!"*

The black haired human round up the rest of the survivors in the city including the mans family

The blonde half elf pulls the man up by his hair and kneels beside him. He whispers into the mans ear

> *"Don't ever try and bargain with me again"*

The players watch as the man with a flick of his hand sends 2 balls of fire incinerating the kneeling man's wife and child. The lieutenant then begins cleaving through the commoners of the city killing several people with each swing of his sword.
The kneeling man screams and weeps struggling on his knees trying to stop them to no avail. You then watch as the half elf than casts a healing spell on the man curing his wounds. The man confused looks up and questions why.

> *"I need you in perfect shape if your going to run along and tell the next city who's coming"*
