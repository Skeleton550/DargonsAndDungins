The session started with The Wizards Three struggling to get the portal open to Eberron. This allowed everyone some free time to rest and gather themselves before heading to the next plane of existence. 

I think you fought the Vecna The Archlich stat block (Maybe)

Neon did (IDK)

Rix bought stuff

Varin helped rebuild Sigil

Bart did (something)

Ferros also did (Something)

Covered by a strange black fog, the portal was then ready for you to head through. On the other side of the portal was the misty view of Khorvaire. Leaving the large black oval portal behind, you ventured out into the thick fog that consumes the realm and inevitably, got lost causing your exploration to take a lot longer than expected. Eventually you managed to come across a camp of veterans and spoke with the apparent leader, Kalyth. She eventually explained that in the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, she lost several valuable magic items and a purse full of gold that she could’ve used to stave off the veterans’ current financial plight. This counted as a secret for you. Kalyth also explained that her group were currently arguing with a group of warforged "marauders" who have no respect for they're situation 

Heading out into the fog again, you came across a friendly group of warforged who helped you navigate out of the fog to their small town. Mercy, the leader, on the way, talks about how they have been visiting ruined colossi to extract docents from them as they are sacred objects to the Warforged. Upon reaching the village, Mercy shows the collection of Docents to the player at which moment the players begin trying to strike a deal with mercy so they can use the only working docent to help them find the next piece of the rod of seven parts. Neon, in this moment has the master but corrupt plan of disguising himself as the hero of the village and trying to convince mercy that their war hero has come back from the grave and is in desperate need of a docent. Surprisingly, that didn't work. After this moment, Rix managed to convince Mercy to allow you to borrow the docent under the basis that you return it before leaving.

With the Docent attuned to the rod piece, it then started pointing you in the direction of the next piece which causes you to eventually arrive at Landro, a 300+ft tall colossus that is half wedged in the side of a mountain. 

While exploring the colossus you come across various remnants of The Last War, including a woman trapped in permanent slumber that causes you to experience the Day of Mourning in the span of a few seconds, and someone that was trapped in a loop of trying to warn his friends that they were about to die.  You also come across a strange grey fluid that warps and changed items or beings that interact with it, Varin, who touched the liquid, was stuck talking in incoherent babbles for the next 8 hours and any non magical weapons placed in it came out with a random trait and some were just destroyed. Eventually you reach a high enough to meet a very racist table and slightly above that is Glaive and her crew of warforged who fight you in the engine room of Landro. After defeating Glaive and her crew you
