Glimmer is a friend of [[Neon]] who travels with him in his adventures. He is a Tressym who, from the outside, comes across as incredibly pompous but helpful to Neon. [[Rix]] attempted to feed Glimmer who refused as he hates being fed by someone else.

Glimmer perished in the Ritual Chamber, after rescuing [[Eldon Keyward]] caused a gigantic necrotic explosion in the Chamber
