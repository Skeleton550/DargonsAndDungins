You, after being shunted through a rift by Vecna at the end of the Neverdeath catacombs, awoke into a green field occupied by children. One gaunt faced child was poking and prodding at an incinerated corpse of a undefinable animal. His mother approached from behind comforting the boy about his bullies. The child and his mother then proceeded to attack you

After defeating the corrupted mother and child, you worked out that you were experiencing Vecna's Memories

The next memory you experienced was a memory of Vecna torturing one of his bullies for insulting his mother. The boy eventually died and his corpse was left in the shed. Rix then proceeded to take 4 gold pieces from the boys corpse.

The next memory was a memory of Vecna losing his mother. He was crouched over a headstone with the name Mazzel engraved into it. The players annoyed Vecna enough to where he killed them.

You then woke up in a garden patio area hearing chatting from nearby. The players approach, invisible, and see Vecna and Kas discussing invasion plans of Oerth.

You then see Vecna and Kas Besieging a city together slaying innocents and burning houses. Rix comforts the only man remaining after the siege by giving him the 4 gold she stole off a child's corpse

Your then transported to a room where you see Vecna giving Kas the gift of an immortal body and a sentient sword

The next memory was Vecna communing with something he defined as "The Serpent". This is where he gained his Lich powers

The final memory you experienced was a memory of the infamous battle where Kas betrayed Vecna killing him and creating the artefacts, the hand and the eye of Vecna.
