GAME RULES

Can change in future

- Silvery Barbs is banned unless someone can come up with a re-work that is good
    
- I don’t like the idea of critical failures like in BG3 so I don’t do critical failures or critical successes.
    
- The result of simulacrum can only use spells of the level simulacrum was cast at and lower
    
- Conjure minor elementals spell scaling is one dice per spell level rather than 2 dice
    
- Exhaustion spells
    

- If a character is out of spell slots yet still wants to cast a spell that requires a spell slot they can.
    
- However they take 2d10 * (spell slot level) necrotic damage and their maximum health is reduced by the same amount and they receive a level of exhaustion
    
- The damage and max health reduction is unavoidable and unresistable and can be removed on a long rest
    
- (Doesn’t apply to warlocks yet, still working on a way for it to.)
    

- Crunchy Criticals (MAYBE) When scoring a critical hit the damage is the maximum value of the damage dice + a regular damage roll
    
- Inspiration at the start of every Long rest. You also get inspiration for acting in character well (if I remember).
    
- When flanking/ attacking an enemy that is unaware of your group's presence and is unaware they are about to be attacked, instead of just having advantage, everyone gets advantage AND a +1 to damage and attack rolls per person flanking the target. Must be attack rolls
    

- For example:
    
- 1 person would get 1 extra damage on the attack
    
- 2 people would get 2 extra damage each
    
- 3 people would get 3 extra damage each and so on
    

- Furthermore a creature attacked this way cannot take reactions until the start of their turn
    
- I’ve been wanting to try out secret death saves that only the DM and the dying player know the result of, hopefully this will add suspense and worry making the players want to wrap up the combat or help within the next 3 rounds
    
- I’m never actively trying to kill anyone but in the event of death, a character, once failing all death saves or being killed, get final words to the party instead of just outright dying
    
- After death if attempting to cast revivify all the requirements must be met, ie.
    

- Must have died within the last minute
    
- Body has to be intact and revivify cannot restore body parts
    
- For example an intact body must:
    

- Not be disintegrated into dust
    
- Not just be viscera
    
- Have all major body parts e.g. head, torso, etc.
    
- The soul must be willing to come back to the body or persuaded to
    
- A character does not have to come back if the player doesn’t want them to
    

- A dead player who cannot be revived can come back in 4 ways (open to more ways)
    

- A search in a distant place to find their soul to bring it back
    
- True Resurrection
    
- Come back as a different character altogether
    
- Come back as a revenge revenant that won't die until whatever they vowed revenge on has been stopped/killed
    

  

“Table” Rules

  

- Main rule is just common sense and treat people how you would want to be treated
    
- I am not a Rules as Written person. If something is ambiguous I will more than likely go with whatever is cool or whatever is intended
    
- Try not to meta-game or heavily power-game, of course a certain amount is unavoidable and I want you to be strong, but being good at everything isn't the goal.
    
- Unless it's something specifically tailored to your own character try not to dominate the conversation too much
    
- Same with combat, try not to take over someone else's turn unless they need help with something
    
- Also relating to combat, if you have full on battle discussions mid round I might try out a rule where unless you explicitly state that you are talking telepathically or in a different language that everyone can speak then the enemy can hear that and plan around it. (I’m open to feedback on this cos it might be shit)
    
- I heavily encourage role play between characters, so have fun with each other, get into character disagreements or forge deep friendships with certain characters, you could even have fights as long as you're having fun with the characters you’ve made
    
- Please give feedback to me about being a DM cos I’m obviously very new to it and I want to make it a fun
    

  

This is obvious but none of these rules are targeted at anyone (I’ve literally ran 1 session after all). It’s just simple and fun stuff that I've come up with and stuff I believe in, just remember to have fun
