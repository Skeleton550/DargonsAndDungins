Laerel Silverhand is on the other side of the portal waiting. Alustriel and Laerel hug each other exclaiming how happy they are the other one is safe. They tell the players that cultists have rule of the city but a rebellion is forming to take it back from them. Five Vecnan cultists sprint towards the party screaming incoherent things brandishing weapons. Alustriel's face turns to anger and here eyes glow a bright yellow.

Two armoured githyanki patrol the deck and below, silver swords at their hips.*\n\nTwo lawful neutral githyanki knights named Lysan and Zastra, who served as bosuns on the Lambent Zenith, keep watch here. Characters who want to avoid the githyanki must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. The knights notice characters who fail the check, beckoning them to approach and state their business.\n\nLysan and Zastra are cautious but friendly. They have a sardonic sense of humour developed after being stranded for so long. If the characters express no hostile intent, the bosuns welcome them to the Lambent Zenith and call for Ilren, who stepped in as the camp’s interim leader when the ship’s first mate fell ill. The githyanki explain that they haven’t heard from the ship’s captain, Inda, who Lysan and Zastra assume either died during the crash or is stranded elsewhere in the wreckage. Lysan and Zastra introduce Ilren to the party.\n\nIf the characters are hostile, Lysan and Zastra shout for help and attack the characters. After all combatants have taken a turn, all five sailors in the upper crew quarters (area Z2) join the fight.\n\nTalking with Lysan and Zastra. Lysan and Zastra know the following information:\n\nLast Voyage. The Lambent Zenith was a sailing ship that sought to herald hope, community, and order across the multiverse. But this mission came to an end a few months ago when the ship collided with the body of a dying god.\n\nStrange Magic. The ship’s prow was outfitted with “fancy magic stuff” beyond the githyanki’s understanding. This magic malfunctioned when the ship crashed, and now teleportation magic used within the wreck is warped. Instead of teleporting creatures, the magic instead spawns a portal that leads somewhere else in the wreckage.\n\nTerrors of Space. The areas beyond the wreck are teeming with hungry astral predators. The survivors are too afraid of these predators to risk traveling between the segments. The camp has also been plagued recently by aberrant monsters such as cloakers, though the survivors don’t know why.\n\nIf asked for specifics, Lysan and Zastra share a look before directing the characters to speak with the second mate, Kycera, in the galley (area Z3). A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that the two are uneasy about some of their crewmates. If the characters press the issue, the githyanki pull them aside and admit that the camp’s interim leader, Ilren, and the Lambent Zenith’s first mate, Figaro, would have more information. However, Figaro has been acting paranoid of late and refuses to leave his quarters (area Z8).\n\nTalking with Ilren. Ilren appears as a boisterous giff—a bulky individual with a head similar to that of a hippopotamus—wearing a sleek red coat. But Ilren is a disguised death slaad who can cast the spell Modify Memory (spell save DC 15) once per day. Ilren is the reason the camp suffers Aberration attacks; the death slaad sneakily directs monsters toward the wreck’s survivors and revels in the victims’ suffering. Ilren also magically modified Figaro’s memories and usurped power in the camp.\n\nOn meeting the characters, Ilren claims to come from a similar background: the giff is an adventurer with heroic dreams who became stranded on this wreck when his skiff crashed into Havock. Ilren claims that nothing of his skiff remains.\n\nIlren welcomes the characters to explore the Lambent Zenith’s wreck and make themselves at home, but a character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check intuits that Ilren’s jolly demeanour belies a suspicious and cold attitude. If asked about Figaro, Ilren breezily explains that Figaro is recovering from an illness but doesn’t elaborate. Ilren adds that he is happy to serve as leader while Figaro is indisposed.\n\nIlren doesn’t reveal its true form unless attacked.","x":1360,"y":-120,"width":1034,"height":1160},

A former pirate, Kycera saw the error of her ways and joined the Lambent Zenith’s crew to find redemption. Now she spends her time in the wreck’s galley. Though the survivors don’t require food in the timeless void of the Astral Sea, Kycera finds that cooking and eating bring the restless survivors comfort.\n\nTalking with Kycera. Kycera gladly discusses the general history of the Lambent Zenith. However, if asked about the rod piece or the security system, Kycera clams up, suspicious of the characters’ motives. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check assures her of their heroic purpose, at which point Kycera reveals the following information:\n\nPrecious Cargo. The Lambent Zenith carried an extremely rare and powerful magic artifact. As a former pirate, Kycera helped Captain Inda design the security system to protect the artifact.\n\nSafe Room. The artifact was stored in a safe room at the front of the ship. During the Lambent Zenith’s crash, arcane wards should have sealed the safe room’s doors. The safe room is inaccessible while the wards are active.\n\nWard Runes. Two runes hidden on the ship power the wards. Kycera knows one rune was placed in the ship’s stateroom, but she doesn’t remember the second rune’s location. She believes that magic or a pass phrase can deactivate the runes. She doesn’t know the pass phrase, but the captain would know.\n\nIf asked about Figaro, Kycera expresses annoyance at his seclusion; her tone belies a sense of parental concern. If the characters help Figaro and defeat Ilren, Kycera is grateful and provides all the information above willingly.\n\nTreasure. Within the pantry are 2d4 unopened casks of aged wine, each worth 500 gp. Kycera happily allows the characters to take them, as she’s concerned about the crew getting too drunk to fend off threats.","x":4760,"y":-120,"width":1034,"height":680},

The remains of his lifeboat rest on the starboard segment.\n\nIf the characters haven’t met Ilren already, Ilren is here playing cards with Daveras.\n\nTalking with Daveras. Though gruff, Daveras is friendly. He shares the following information:\n\nMissing Camp Member. Daveras’s usual card partner, a halfling woman named Cirit, hasn’t shown up for their games lately. Camp members said Cirit left to scout the other wreck segments, but Daveras seems doubtful. Unknown to Daveras, Cirit is actually in the Lambent Zenith’s brig (area Z9).\n\nParanoid Leader. Figaro, the camp’s first leader, locked himself in his quarters and refuses to communicate. Daveras tried to talk to him, but Figaro used a magical device to erect an impenetrable barrier around the room.\n\nPersonal History. Daveras wasn’t part of the Lambent Zenith’s crew. When his spelljamming ship, the Verdant Branch, was attacked by space pirates, he escaped on a lifeboat with his best friend, a blink dog named Ikasa, as well as a treant named Redbud, who had grown into the lifeboat’s hull. The lifeboat crashed into a different segment of the wreck, and Daveras outran the raiders to get to the camp on the stern segment. He believes no one else survived.\n\nIf Ilren isn’t present, Daveras confides that he noticed Figaro’s odd paranoia started shortly after Ilren arrived.\n\nIf Daveras is reunited with Ikasa (found in area Z12), he is elated and happily vouches for the characters when talking to Figaro in area Z5.","x":5840,"y":-120,"width":1034,"height":620},

Due to his paranoid state, Figaro uses a Cube of Force to deter any living matter from entering his room.\n\nA character trying to sneak up to Figaro’s locked door must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid being noticed. An unnoticed character can, as an action, use thieves’ tools to try to pick the door’s lock, doing so with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.\n\nGaining Figaro’s Trust. Figaro deactivates the cube’s barrier if he feels he can trust the characters. The barrier allows sound to pass through, meaning that the characters can talk with Figaro.

On a successful check, Figaro trusts the characters, unlocks the door, and permits the characters to enter.\n\nBy helping the people found throughout the wreck, the party can find individuals who will vouch for them.

If Figaro allowed the characters into his room willingly or if enough individuals vouch for them, Figaro shakily introduces himself and is willing to talk to the characters. Otherwise, he screams and attacks. Figaro surrenders after he is reduced to half of his hit point maximum, but he still refuses to talk with the characters.\n\nTalking with Figaro. If the characters gained Figaro’s trust, he answers questions about the Lambent Zenith. He knows the following:\n\nExperiments with the Rod. The Lambent Zenith harnessed the conjuration magic within a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts to create portals that allow the ship to quickly traverse the multiverse. The rod piece was stored below the bridge on the ship’s prow.\n\nEmergency Security Protocol. Knowing that the rod piece shouldn’t fall into the wrong hands, the Lambent Zenith’s captain installed a security protocol that sealed the rod piece’s location in the event of an emergency—such as a crash. As far as Figaro knows, the rod remains in the safe room (area Z19), though that area is inaccessible due to the activated safety protocol.\n\nWard Runes. The security protocol is fueled by two runes in different locations aboard the ship. Both runes must be dispelled to access the room that holds the rod piece. Figaro knows the runes are invisible. He also knows one rune is located in this stateroom, on the bed’s headboard, while the other is in the ship’s study (area Z13) on the wall above the desk. He suspects casting Dispel Magic on a rune would deactivate it, but the caster needs to see the rune. He also suspects the captain knew another way to deactivate it. If she survived on another segment, the characters could try to reach her to ask; if not, it might be recorded it in her notes.\n\nMending Figaro’s Memories. Ilren used repeated Modify Memory spells to manipulate Figaro’s mind. A character who studies Figaro’s symptoms and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Figaro’s glassy gaze as a telltale sign of memory-tampering magic. Restoring Figaro’s true memories causes Figaro to immediately recall Ilren’s deception. If the characters haven’t confronted Ilren, Figaro rushes off to face the death slaad.\n\nFigaro’s Secret. After recovering his memories, Figaro remains agitated even if he confronts Ilren. If the characters ask what’s bothering him, Figaro admits he knew about the dangers of this stretch of Astral Sea but didn’t warn the captain, since this route was economical and Figaro believed it would be easy for the crew to traverse.\n\nRegardless of the characters’ reaction to this revelation, learning it counts as a secret for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book’s introduction.\n\nWard Rune.

Her right leg below her knee is a wood-and-metal prosthetic, and from her back extends a massive, white-feathered wing.*\n\nThe one-winged woman is the captain of the Lambent Zenith, Inda Malayuri. Inda uses the deva stat block, except she has a flying speed of 0 feet.\n\nInda’s right leg and wing were severed in an attack years ago. She now uses prosthetics, but her prosthetic wing was damaged in the crash. She has been trying to repair it in the navigation room (area Z16). She is determined to escape the wreck and reunite with whatever remains of her crew, though she worries the rod piece will be stolen by raiders if she leaves.\n\nTalking with Inda. Having encountered raiders attempting to pillage the wreck, Inda is wary of the characters and pointedly asks about their motives. She is hesitant to provide any information about the Lambent Zenith’s cargo—especially the rod piece—and isn’t swayed by bribes or threats.\n\nA character talking with Inda can make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If a character offers to aid her with repairing her prosthetic wing or to reunite her with her crew in the stern segment, this check is made with advantage. On a successful check, Inda agrees to help the characters. In addition to the general history of the Lambent Zenith, Inda knows the following points of information:\n\nLocation of the Rod Piece. The rod piece was stored in a safe room directly beneath the ship’s bridge. To protect the rod piece from raiders, the safe room was equipped with magical security wards that triggered when the ship crashed.\n\nDeactivating the Ward Runes. The safe room’s wards are powered by two runes. One is located on the headboard of the bed in the ship’s stateroom, and the other is in the study, on the wall above the desk. The runes are invisible, and both runes need to be deactivated to access the safe room. Inda knows the pass phrase for deactivating both runes: “The moon sings a song for the lost.”\n\nWhat’s in the Heart. Inda has avoided exploring Havock. However, she’s seen a serpentine monster emerge from Havock’s heart.\n\nIf the characters have no way to see the invisible ward runes, Inda lends the party a Lantern of Revealing.\n\nTreasure. Inda has a Flame Tongue shortsword and a Ring of Evasion on her bedside table next to the Lantern of Revealing. If asked, Inda is reluctant to give away the shortsword or ring but can be convinced with a successful DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Inda has a key to the strongbox in area Z13 and knows where the secret compartment holding a Spell Scroll of Flame Strike is in area Z17; she mentions these to the characters if they help her with her prosthetic wing in area Z16 or help her reach her crew in the stern segment.\n\nAs an action, a character who can reach the bedside table can try to steal one of the magic items atop it without being seen by Inda, doing so with a successful DC 19 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. On a failed check, Inda sees the attempt and immediately becomes hostile.","x":17720,"y":-120,"width":1034,"height":920},

Inda’s prosthetic wing sits on the centre table. Inda has been trying to repair it, but while she excels at theoretical studies, she is inexperienced with practical engineering.\n\nCharacters can attempt to help Inda repair the prosthetic wing. A character must first succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check to know which joints must be reconnected. Then, the character must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to reconnect the joints; a character who has proficiency with tinker’s tools makes this check with advantage.\n\nOnce a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check has been made, Inda knows she can tinker with the wing enough that it will eventually work.\n\nInda is grateful to the characters for their help fixing the broken wing, even if their efforts are unsuccessful. If the characters escort her to the stern segment of the wreck, she vouches for the characters to Figaro in area Z5.","x":18800,"y":-120,"width":1034,"height":440},

Over time, the heart spawned a parasitic monstrosity known as a hertilod, which feasts on the god’s residual divine power and terrorizes hapless astral travelers who stumble on Havock’s corpse. When the Lambent Zenith crashed into Havock, the god’s heart began absorbing pieces of the ship’s prow, and the hertilod gorged itself on the spelljamming vessel’s detritus—including the piece of the Rod of Seven Parts.\n\n## General Features\nThe areas of the heart of Havock have the following notable features:\n\nFoul Air. The air throughout the heart is foul. Any creature that breathes the foul air has the poisoned condition until it breathes fresh air again.\n\nLighting. All areas inside the heart are dimly lit by floating orbs of pinkish bioluminescence.\n\nWalls, Ceiling, and Floor. The walls, ceiling, and floor of the heart are made of purple flesh. Parts of this flesh have been petrified, hardening into gray crystal, while other parts remain soft and spongy. The heart beats erratically, sending a dull pulse echoing through its chambers every few minutes. The ceilings in the heart are all 50 feet high.","x":-1040,"y":2560,"width":800,"height":560},

A character can move through the area without waking the hertilod by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity (Stealth) check. Otherwise, the hertilod wakes when it detects a creature within 30 feet of itself and attacks.\n\nRetrieving the Rod Piece. The rod piece is deep within the hertilod’s gullet. If the hertilod is forced to regurgitate creatures in its gullet, roll a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, the rod piece is also regurgitated and lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the hertilod. Alternatively, a creature within the hertilod’s gullet can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, finding the rod piece on a successful check.

From this distance you see and amalgamation of mass behind the ribcage, black starry flesh and half grey petrified stone. A hole in the heart opens it up.\n\nReaching the entrance to the heart it opens up to a fleshy interior. A black mass hovers high of the ground in the centre of the room.\n\nGetting closer the the mass, you see its decorated with white dots and streaks with a deep purple hue displaying constellations. As you get within about 60ft of the mass it begins to subtly vibrate and shake and the constellation pattern on it splits down the middle. Both sides of the constellation pattern move aside revealing a curled up dragon. The constellation pattern was the dragons wings which it wrapped around itself. As the dragon unfurls itself it reveals its deep black, purple and blue skin. It's claws and teeth are jet black and seem to disrupt the very light surrounding them. Spikes cover the dragons exterior and also turn into that same jet black the more the dragon unfurls from its slumber. Its pupils are black with the surrounding area being a depiction of purples greens blacks and blues representing space. The dragon locks eyes with Neon and its brow furrows as you feel a rustling on your belt. The divine bone shard you were carrying flies across the room in front of the dragon as he seems to inspect it.\n\n\"So you are the one who has been reaching out to Celestian. I suppose you have been harnessing the remaining power in this bone shard of his. I am Astrophel and I've been waiting for you to show up as I would like to strike a deal with you.

The final step for me in absorbing the rest of his power requires me to concentrate on the absorption process. During this time Celestian is likely to use the remainder of his strength to manifest himself to try and stop me. When he manifests you are going to help me by holding him off till I've fully taken his powers as the God of Space. If you don't then we will fight, If you loose I will kill you and bind your soul to mine and you will be forced to have me as your patron, doing my bidding whenever I please then you will help me with the absorption process...
