Also known as the City of Doors. Sigil is a place at the centre of the outlands. The players arrived here after walking through a portal shortly after Neverwinter was invaded by Vecnan cultists. 

Neon is originally from Sigil and Bartholamew has passed through a couple times. None of the other party members knew of Sigil's existence. Upon arrival the players followed a line of Vecnan cultist corpses that lead them into an open plaza where the Lady of Pain was chained up on display, dead and dripping blood. Further following the corpses the players came across an illusory wall

## The Sanctum

The Sanctum is a space inside of Sigil crafted by [[Alustriel Silverhand|Alustriel]] herself for political discussions, events and as a safe harbour in case of emergency. Upon arriving here, the players saw Alustriel [[Tasha]] and [[Mordenkainen]] fighting the remaining Vecnan cultists. The players shortly after explored the Sanctum including everyone's rooms.
