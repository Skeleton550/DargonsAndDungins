The session began with Neon questioning the Wizards Three about the Rod of Seven parts among other things. 

You  then all disguised as Llolth worshippers and infiltrated Web's Edge where you came across some worshippers praying who then ignored them. Carrying on further through the hideout you came across some prisoners, one of which you let out to form an alliance with who then almost immediately betrayed you, initiating a fight. 

You then pressed further through the dungeon finding bones and signs of some pet that the cultists kept mentioning, eventually stumbling into the Spider dragon's lair and fighting both it and the Yochol. 

After fighting you retreated back to the portal but instead of it taking you back to the Sanctum it took you to just outside of Baldurs Gate where you met a caravan that had been mauled by some animal. In the back were some restrained and knocked out people who told you that they were kidnapped for knowing something about an obelisk.

Following the path made by the Rod of Seven parts piece it led you into a sanctum of Bhaal where Varin's thought to be dead brother told the players that he had become leader of the Zhentarim and chosen of Bhaal. He offered Varin to join him which Varin promptly refused and a fight broke out where Varin's brother transformed into a Slayer using his Bhaalist blood. Halfway through the fight it transformed again into a Bhaal Ravager. Eventually you took down the Ravager and Varin's brother was no more once again.
