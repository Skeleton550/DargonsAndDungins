Varin Thorne is a high ranking member of the Lord's Alliance from [[Neverwinter]] who helps the others rescue the 4 prisoners from Neverdeath Catacombs. Varin worships Tempus who is the true neutral God of War. Varin noticed that [[Neon]] was wearing a medallion of Tempus on his belt which Neon brushed off making Varin suspicious.

[[Vecna]] called Varin *"failure of a noble"* before banishing him to the Shadowfell

Varin and the party after retrieving the 1st piece of the [[Rod of Seven Parts]], headed back to the portal which strangely took them to Baldurs Gate instead of the Sanctum. Varin followed the path showed to him by the rod piece and came across his, thought to be dead, brother. The brother offered Varin to join him, the Zhentarim and Bhaal, but Varin declined and they fought. The fight ended in Varin's brothers death and the obelisk in the Bhaal sanctum being destroyed.
