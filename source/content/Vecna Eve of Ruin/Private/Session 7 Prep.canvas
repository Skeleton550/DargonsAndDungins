They feel guilty that they haven’t searched for Filch. Characters can learn Mercy’s secret in the “Warforged Pilgrims” section later in this chapter.\n\nKalyth’s Secret.

		{"id":"a80248b71faa2078","type":"text","text":"# Information\n\nBefore seeking the third rod piece, the characters can rest and prepare in the sanctum in Sigil. By doing some research in Sigil or conversing with the Wizards Three, the characters can learn the following about their next destination:\n\nRuins of War. The Mournland is a ruined wasteland. Before the Last War—a global conflict waged across the continent of Khorvaire for over a century—the Mournland was the nation of Cyre. An apocalyptic event called the Day of Mourning destroyed Cyre and transformed the region. Remnants of the Last War’s battlefields, such as the fire-spewing war machines known as colossi, lie strewn about the Mournland, and warforged wander the land.\n\nWarforged. Warforged are common on Khorvaire. These Constructs are formed from wood and steel, then magically imbued with life and sentience. Warforged were originally created to fight in the Last War, though many survived that conflict and now try to understand their place in the world.\n\n## An Important Detail\nUnreliable Magic. In the Mournland, magic doesn’t always function as intended, particularly teleportation and divination magic. See the “Regional Effects” section later in this chapter for more.\n\nBefore the characters leave Sigil for Mount Ironrot, the Wizards Three share their concerns that this rod piece will be particularly challenging to find since the Mournland is difficult to navigate. The wizards suspect that the rod piece is hidden in one of the dozens of ruined colossi scattered across Mount Ironrot (as shown on map 4.1).\n\nInstead of searching each colossus individually, the wizards suggest augmenting the rod’s divining power with local magic that can penetrate the Mournland’s impeded navigation. The characters can do this by tuning their second rod piece to a working Docent from inside one of the fallen colossi. A Docent is a small, sentient metal sphere that employs its sentience and magic on behalf of an attuned warforged; the full description of a Docent is found in the “Finding a Docent” section later in this chapter. The wizards correctly postulate that a Docent’s magic will stabilize and augment the rod’s divining powers so it will directly point the way to the third piece.\n\n## About Docents\nLong ago, colossi were powered and controlled by Docents. The techniques and tools to create Docents were lost, but working Docents can sometimes still be found in colossi. The Wizards Three suggest the characters find a working Docent and tune it to the rod piece.\n\n## Mount Ironrot\nWhen the characters are ready, they can step through the doorway in Sigil. They arrive outside a jet-black, glass oval portal near the slopes of Mount Ironrot.\n\n\n","x":1160,"y":560,"width":687,"height":1260},
		{"id":"f32c665867f9d3f6","type":"text","text":"# Exploration\n\n### Regional Effects\nMount Ironrot is affected by these environmental phenomena:\n\n### Impeded Navigation\nIn outdoor areas, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate.\n\n### Lightly Obscured\nMist perpetually shrouds outdoor areas, rendering them lightly obscured.\n\n### Muddled Magic\nCreatures and objects within 1 mile of Mount Ironrot can’t be perceived through magical scrying sensors. Spells or magical effects that would reveal a creature’s or object’s location fail while that creature or object is within 1 mile of the mountain. The third piece of the Rod of Seven Parts points only to Mount Ironrot without precision.\n\n### Traveling\nDistances between locations anywhere in the Mournland are indeterminate and ever-changing. Map 4.1 shows the approximate positions of locations around Mount Ironrot relative to one another. The map doesn’t include a scale due to this effect.\n\nWhenever the characters travel from one location to another, roll 2d4 to determine the number of hours it takes the party to reach their destination. Have the players designate one party member to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the group each time the characters travel. On a failed check, double the number of hours the party must travel to reach their destination.\n\n### Dangers\nThere is no safe food to forage in the Mournland, and monsters are everywhere. If the party lingers too long between locations, introduce random encounters with creatures such as blazebears (see appendix A) or blade scouting parties (see the “Blade Scouting Party” section later in this chapter).\n\n","x":1880,"y":560,"width":687,"height":1080},

The oval reflects the surrounding mist-shrouded landscape with supernatural clarity. The oval looks like a giant mirror, but it functions as a door between here and Sigil.*\n\nA Detect Magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from the oval. This oval served as a conduit for powerful teleportation magic in Cyre, but the Day of Mourning rendered its magic unstable. The oval serves as a portal to Sigil while the characters carry the second piece of the rod.\n\nIf a creature tries to teleport to the Mournland using a Teleport spell, a Plane Shift spell, or similar magic, the spell’s caster must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails and has no effect. On a successful save, the spell works, but teleported creatures arrive in an empty space near this oval, regardless of their intended destination in the Mournland.\n\nA creature that studies the reflection of the Mournland in the oval clearly sees the ruined colossi, the veterans’ camp, and Ialos (see map 4.1 and the sections below).

These are warforged pilgrims. Each uses the warforged warrior stat block (see appendix A).\n\nThe pilgrims are peaceful folk who wander the Mournland in search of friendly travelers and artifacts important to warforged. A purple-hued ex-soldier named Mercy is the group’s leader. Mercy is initially indifferent to the characters, but the leader responds positively to any aid the characters offer, such as advice or adventuring supplies.\n\nPilgrims’ Problems\nAt first, Mercy speaks vaguely about the pilgrims’ goals. If the characters offer aid or helpful advice, Mercy talks about the pilgrims’ expeditions to ruined colossi. Mercy then tells the characters that the pilgrims have been extracting Docents from these ruins, and that the pilgrims consider the items sacred. Mercy also talks about the pilgrims’ recent run-ins with rival salvagers. Mercy mentions two other groups in particular: a band of Cyran veterans that watches Mercy’s group from the shadows, and a gang of openly hostile warforged that the pilgrims avoid at all costs. This latter group, Mercy explains, is loyal to the Lord of Blades, a local warmonger who conscripts warforged to his bloody cause of wiping out anyone who opposes him.\n\nIf the characters offer to help the pilgrims, Mercy suggests they meet at the pilgrims’ base in Ialos (see “Ialos” earlier in this chapter). Mercy and the pilgrims happily travel with the characters, though they hide if violence breaks out, emerging only when it’s safe. If the characters wish to attend to other business before meeting the pilgrims at Ialos, Mercy draws a rough map in the mud to show the way. The pilgrims head straight to Ialos and are there when the characters arrive.\n\nMercy’s Secret. If the characters befriend Mercy, they sense during their conversations with the warforged that something weighs heavily on Mercy. If the characters ask the warforged about their melancholy, Mercy asks to speak with the characters privately. In private, Mercy admits that their best friend has been missing in the Mournland since the Day of Mourning. Weighted with the responsibility of leadership, Mercy has never searched for this friend, a blue-and-red warforged named Filch. If the characters offer to search for Filch, they find the ex-soldier in area L4 of Landro.\n\nRegardless of the characters’ reaction to this revelation or whether they offer to look for Filch, learning it counts as a secret for the purposes of the Power of Secrets rules in this book’s introduction.","x":4760,"y":560,"width":687,"height":1020},

The windmill’s sides and blades are reinforced with badly rusted steel plates, and the attached wooden outbuilding is in shambles. Muddy roads separate the mill from the ruined buildings. In the centre of a nearby intersection stands an eroded stone statue of a humanoid draped in colourful scraps of cloth.*\n\nMournland-roaming pilgrims (see the “Warforged Pilgrims” section later in this chapter) turned this ruined mill into an ossuary for fallen warforged.\n\nFrom this base, pilgrims venture out to find relics or lost warforged. At such times, 2d4 pilgrims (use the warforged warrior stat block in appendix A) remain in Ialos to guard the mill or patrol its surroundings. When no expedition is underway, thirteen pilgrims (including their leader, Mercy, who also uses the warforged warrior stat block) occupy Ialos. The pilgrims defend their home against attackers, but they flee when they’re outmatched.\n\nFounder’s Statue. Colorful scraps of fabric drape over the shoulders and outstretched arm of this statue. The warforged pilgrims decorated the statue of Ialos’s founder as a gesture of respect; they are grateful to the village’s original builders for creating this space they can use to mourn.\n\nMill. The millstones have been removed from this mill, leaving an empty space. Warforged pilgrims use the mill to plan expeditions.\n\nOssuary. Bodies of deceased warforged line this cleared-out basement.

Some of these items had magical properties until the Day of Mourning destroyed their magic. The storeroom’s notable treasures include the following:\n\nArt Objects. Clean tapestries, intact sculptures, and leather-wrapped oil paintings are carefully piled in a corner of the storeroom. Altogether, these relics of old Cyre are worth 2,000 gp.\n\nDocents. Half a dozen metal orbs line one shelf, but only one is a functional Docent (see the “Docent” section later in this chapter). These items were taken from the area’s ruined colossi.

Once it’s clear the characters aren’t monsters or violent marauders, the wanderers introduce themselves as the Turquoise Spear, a small platoon of Cyran ex-soldiers that scours the Mournland for relics.\n\nAn orc artillerist named Kalyth speaks for her companions, two halfling soldiers named Dortle-Lynn and Grezan. Kalyth explains that the Turquoise Spear recently discovered a stockpile of Docents taken from colossi. She wants to claim the Docents to sell in markets outside the Mournland, but she’d happily let the characters borrow a Docent beforehand. Unfortunately, Kalyth says, the Docent stockpile is in Ialos, a ruined village currently occupied by “rogue warforged.” The Turquoise Spear attempted to infiltrate the ruins, but the warforged made it clear they wouldn’t give up their stockpile without a fight.\n\nKalyth doesn’t know that the warforged are peaceful pilgrims, nor does she know that the pilgrims regard the Docents as sacred. Regardless of these facts, the veteran insists that these treasures rightfully belong to “living, breathing Cyrans.”\n\nIf the characters agree to help the Turquoise Spear, Kalyth gives the party directions to Ialos (see “Ialos” earlier in this chapter). She adds that the town’s most prominent structure is a large metal windmill that glints faintly in the mist.\n\nBlade Scouting Party\nAs they pass between scorched thickets, the characters are ambushed by violent followers of a bloodthirsty warmonger called the Lord of Blades. These scouts have orders to search the region for a suitable colossus to turn into a new outpost, but they’ll happily make time to slay a few people in their way. The scouting party includes two blade scouts and one blade lieutenant (see appendix A for both stat blocks).\n\nThe blades fight until destroyed. They remain tight-lipped if captured, but if a character demands information and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, the lieutenant says his party’s commander is a powerful warforged headhunter named Glaive. “She’ll make mincemeat out of you, interlopers!” the lieutenant scoffs.

		{"id":"27d2326f7dfeda4f","type":"text","text":"# The Dispute\n\nBy the time the characters reach Ialos, they should have met the pilgrims and the Cyran veterans. Both sides might ask the characters to intervene and resolve their dispute. Here is a breakdown of the situation:\n\nWhat Kalyth Wants. The Cyran veterans want to sell treasures from their ruined homeland in markets outside the Mournland. With the money, Kalyth says, she and her comrades can fund new, better lives for themselves.\n\nWhat Mercy Wants. Mercy regards Docents (and any other items intended for warforged use) as sacred. The pilgrims believe that such objects belong in the hands of warforged who fought in the Last War.\n\nWhat They’ll Settle For. Ultimately, Kalyth’s group wants money, and Mercy’s group wants respect. If both parties get what they want, the dispute ends.\n\nSettling the Dispute\nMercy doesn’t understand that the Cyran veterans’ true motivation is money, nor does Mercy recognize the value of the items in the pilgrims’ possession. Though reluctant to bargain with the veterans, whom the pilgrims consider warmongers, Mercy can be persuaded to negotiate if the characters act as intermediaries.\n\nIf the characters explain the veterans’ financial need and convince Mercy that the veterans mean no harm, Mercy offers to give the characters the art objects kept in the pilgrims’ storeroom. If a character succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check during this discussion, Mercy also offers the characters the Ring of Feather Falling in the storeroom.\n\nKalyth doesn’t realize that the pilgrims’ have valuable art objects or a magic ring. If told about these treasures, Kalyth says the Cyran veterans would gladly take either option instead of the Docents. If Mercy offers the ring as well, Kalyth insists the characters keep either the art or the ring, whichever they’d prefer, in thanks for brokering a peaceful resolution.\n\nHelpful Information\nIf the resolution allows the warforged pilgrims to keep their Docents and no one is harmed in the dispute, once it’s clear the characters are looking for a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, Mercy tells the characters the following about Landro’s unique power source:\n\n> *“I’ve heard tales of an unusual colossus called Landro powered not by a Docent, but by a device called a graymatter engine that incorporated part of an artifact—perhaps that’s what you seek? The graymatter engine was said to generate a magical barrier around Landro, making it impossible to enter Landro except where the barrier has already been broken.”*\n\nIf the characters negotiate a deal that the Turquoise Spear finds agreeable, Kalyth tells the party the following about the third rod piece:\n\n> *“Rumor has it there’s a colossus powered by part of an artifact. Supposedly, if you remove this piece, the colossus will begin a self-destruct sequence, and there’s no way to stop the colossus from detonating in a terrible conflagration.”*\n\n## Tuning the Rod\nRegardless of which side, if any, the characters take in this conflict, the characters must pair the second piece of the Rod of Seven Parts to the working Docent in Ialos to continue the adventure. (A character need not be attuned to the Docent to pair the Docent to the rod piece.)\n\nWhen a character touches the rod pieceto the working Docent, the piece emits a loud, metallic ping. Thereafter, the piece points in the direction of the third rod piece inside Landro. If the party travels in that direction, the characters eventually reach the ruins of Landro (see the “Landro” section below).","x":6960,"y":560,"width":687,"height":1520},

When she becomes aware of the party’s presence in Landro, Glaive relishes the opportunity to destroy these “meddlesome interlopers,” as she calls them.\n\nGlaive is accompanied by two blade scouts (see appendix A) named Rack and Crunch. The three blades prefer to split up and sneak around Landro and the adjoining caves. They take turns using hit-and-run tactics to harry the characters, creating a sense that more blades lurk around every corner.

The areas affected by these effects are denoted on map 4.3 as the swirled features in areas L5, area L6, area L7, area L8, and area L9. These have the following effects:\n\nAntigravity Wells. Landro’s ankles, legs, knees, hips, spine, and elbow are filled with magical energy meant to allow the colossus’s body to bend and rotate freely. Creatures and objects can enter and exit these permeable “antigravity wells” like any normal space. While inside an antigravity well, a creature is affected by a Levitate spell (no saving throw). Regular notches in the walls make it relatively easy for creatures to move up or down a well to reach other areas of the colossus.\n\nGravity Tiles. Landro’s upper levels are enchanted with gravity magic that keeps passengers safely rooted to the floor. Creatures can move across the floor in areas L20–areaL28 normally, no matter the orientation of Landro’s upper body.\n\nThe effects of the antigravity wells and the gravity tiles end if Landro’s shutdown sequence is activated (see the “Shutdown Sequence” section later in this chapter).\n\nCeilings\nThe height of the ceilings varies considerably in Landro; see individual area descriptions for details. In areas L1–areaL4 of the cave network, the ceilings are 15 feet high unless otherwise noted.\n\nGraymatter Fluid\nA steady stream of thin, oily liquid leaks from the graymatter engine and runs into other parts of Landro and the connected caverns. This graymatter fluid is the engine’s sensory appendage. The graymatter engine can’t move or control this liquid, but it has blindsight within 60 feet of anywhere the graymatter fluid touches.\n\nWhen a creature looks at a puddle of graymatter fluid, the creature sees a twisted, monstrous version of itself with an inscrutable expression rather than its actual reflection. A creature that ingests any amount of graymatter fluid must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or experience the following effects:\n\nAltered Speech. The creature gains telepathy to a range of 30 feet but loses the ability to speak. Any attempts to speak generate only incoherent babbling. This effect ends after the creature finishes a long rest.\n\nPsychic Damage. For each ounce of graymatter fluid consumed, the creature takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage. A creature killed by this damage rises as a zombie 1d4 hours after dying.\n\nInvisible Barrier\nThe graymatter engine creates an invisible barrier around the intact parts of Landro. Nothing can penetrate the barrier, which is similar to the effect of a Wall of Force spell, though a Disintegrate spell can’t destroy it. The barrier is broken in compromised sections of Landro (areas L5, areaL11, and areaL16).\n\nLighting\nLandro’s interior areas and the adjoining caves are dark. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark. During the day, the parts of Landro exposed to the outdoors are shrouded in the same lightly obscuring mist as the rest of Mount Ironrot (see “Exploring Mount Ironrot” earlier in this chapter).\n\nWalls\nAs long as the graymatter engine is active, Landro’s body—which is made from steel-plated stone blocks—is immune to damage. The adjacent caves are made of naturally formed stone.","x":420,"y":2960,"width":687,"height":1520},

It sensed the characters when they first entered Landro and has watched them curiously. When the characters arrive in this room, the graymatter engine manifests a swirling mass of animated graymatter fluid.\n\nThe animated fluid takes the shape of a tall, lithe humanoid and introduces itself as Landro. This neutral-aligned being uses the water elemental stat block, except it has telepathy out to 30 feet.\n\nLandro isn’t interested in fighting. Rather, it wants to question the newcomers who’ve made it all the way to the colossus’s uppermost level.\n\nLandro the Host\nIn its manifestation as Landro, the graymatter engine assumes the role of a gracious host. It is far more interested in learning about its visitors than in talking about itself. If pushed, Landro briefly explains how it was created by Cyran mages to control the colossus of the same name. On the day of its deployment, the colossus teleported halfway into this mountain, where it has remained since. Unable to wrench its body from Mount Ironrot, the graymatter engine fell into a despondent torpor that lasted until the arrival of its recent visitors.\n\nSharing Secrets\nLandro understands the world by peering into the thoughts and memories of living beings. During conversation, the entity asks the characters to share a secret with it.\n\n> *“I already know a great deal,” Landro says. “The knowledge I now seek is of the clandestine variety. I would be interested to learn your secrets.”*\n\nLandro wishes to learn secrets from the characters through a type of osmosis. Landro tells the characters that this process is harmless and takes only a moment, though it does require physical contact with the head of a consenting character, as well as spending a secret the character has learned. If the characters reject the idea, Landro doesn’t push the matter.\n\nIf the characters consent to the entity’s request, Landro extends a ribbonlike tentacle of graymatter fluid. Landro uses this tentacle to briefly touch the head of each consenting character in turn. An affected character hears a deep, sloshing sound and experiences a sensation like being underwater, but when the tentacle is removed, the character is as dry as before.\n\nAfter this process, Landro nods in quiet appreciation and thanks the party for sharing their secrets.\n\nSecrets Revealed. If any character consents to the graymatter engine’s secret-learning process, the most recent secret the party learned is spent, as described in “The Power of Secrets” section in the book’s introduction. Instead of the usual benefit of spending the secret, the characters all gain inspiration. Mark off a secret spent in this way on the Secrets Tracker in appendix C. No matter how many characters consent, only one secret is spent.\n\nThe Engine’s Aid\nIf the characters befriend Landro, or if two or more of the characters agree to share a secret with it, the entity warns the party of the engine room’s defense sentinels and explains how the colossus’s shutdown sequence works. Even though it is mentally merged with the colossus of the same name, the entity can’t control the colossus’s systems.\n\nCrystal Companion\nAt the end of their conversation, Landro asks to travel with the party so it can continue to learn from them. If the characters find a special kind of gem called an id crystal, Landro explains, they can transfer the graymatter engine’s consciousness to it. Landro tells the characters that a suitable id crystal can be found in the colossus’s left foot (area L6).\n\nWhen an id crystal touches the graymatter engine, the graymatter engine’s consciousness is transferred to the crystal, which becomes an Elemental Gem (emerald).\n\nAs soon as the graymatter engine’s consciousness is transferred to the id crystal, the rod piece powering the graymatter engine falls to the floor, activating the hidden sentinels in area L28 and starting Landro’s shutdown sequence (see below).\n\nShutdown Sequence\nWhen Landro’s shutdown sequence is activated, a magical, soothing voice announces: “One minute until self-destruct.” The following things then happen immediately:\n\nAntigravity Deactivated. Landro’s antigravity magic—including the antigravity wells and floors—is dispelled.\n\nBarrier Dropped. The invisible barrier around Landro disappears.\n\nSelf-Destruct Initiated. Characters inside Landro must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have the prone condition as the colossus heaves and shudders. After 1 minute, the colossus explodes in a fiery conflagration. When this happens, creatures inside Landro must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 99 (18d10) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Unattended, nonmagical objects inside Landro are destroyed by the explosion.","x":21300,"y":2960,"width":687,"height":2040},
