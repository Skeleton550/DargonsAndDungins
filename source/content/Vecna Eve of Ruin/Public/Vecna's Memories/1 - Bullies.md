The players see a vision of a half-elf child, around 8 years old. Gaunt-faced, thin limbed, and pale complexion, he sniffles in frustration about being bullied. He sits on the ground poking at the mangled charred corpse of an unidentifiable animal. He grins when corpse gushes a bit more blood. After a time, the gentle female figure comes up behind him and expresses how proud she is.

> *"You'll be great and powerful one day my boy, don't worry"*


> "*I'll teach them a lesson some day"*

The young boy and the older female snap round to face you staring blankly at The players. The environment around you starts to disintegrate into purple nothingness. The woman and boys left eye and left hand begin to turn black and rotten and they lift their now skeletal hand at you and begin pointing. The skin on their faces begin dripping and orifices start leaking.
