The players see a vision of a cemetery at night. A half-elf man dressed in mage's robes kneels at a graveside. He holds wilted lilies in his hand. He has a vacant expression, empty and grief stricken. He mutters to himself, 

> *"She can't leave me here... I should have been stronger... It shouldn't be allowed... It isn't fair... "*

The players walk up to the grieving boy and are encouraged to console him.

The half-elf shoots upright in anger, summoning a spectral hand to choke the newcomer and lift them by the neck. As the person struggles, the young man's tear-stained face is warped in fury as he proclaims, 

He summons 3 spectral hands grasping you all round the neck while he holds the wilted lilies aloft in his other hand. His eyes and hands grow an unnatural green as transfers your life force into the flowers. Your bodies goes limp as the flowers replenish, and the half-elf delicately places the flowers on the grave before storming away from the corpse.
