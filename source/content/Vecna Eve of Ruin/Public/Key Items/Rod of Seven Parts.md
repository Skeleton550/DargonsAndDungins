> *It was the centrepiece of a story concerning a long-ago "great war" between characters known as Wind Dukes of Aaqa and the Queen of Chaos. At the time the artifact was in one piece, and was known as The Rod of Law. In the story, the Rod of Law was used in the Battle of Pesh to imprison the Queen's greatest general, a demon known as Miska the Wolf-Spider, Prince of Demons. The rod was broken into seven fragments during this conflict, and the seven individual pieces were scattered across the world.* - Mordenkainen
