Evernight is the complete opposite of Neverwinter in the Shadowfell. It is mostly occupied by undead with vampires being very common. The players met Sangora here, a vampire that told the player information about Evernight in exchange for some information about the players.

## The Dolindar Tomb

The players were told by Sangora about a crevice of dusk in the tomb that will take them back to Neverwinter. Before entering they were ambushed by three vampires who thought they'd try and make a quick meal out of the party. After defeating them they entered the tomb and came across Newmy, a ghost who works as a cleaner for the tombs, she told them about the Dolindars in rooms ahead who "weren't resting properly". They then carried on and fought the siblings and the matron in there sorrowsworn forms before heading back to Neverwinter
