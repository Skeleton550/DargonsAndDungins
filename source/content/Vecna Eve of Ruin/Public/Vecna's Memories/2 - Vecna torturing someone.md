The players see a familiar pale half-elf, now a young man in his late teens. He stands in a darkened shed, standing over a cowering figure. The young man is holding a lash made of fire and he kicks and whips at a similarly aged young man on who is bound on the ground, a sneering smile on his face.

> *"You thought I was weak, but you were wrong! You are the weak one! You thought you could say those things about my mother and it would go unpunished? You are a swine unfit to utter her name!"*

The bound teen whimpers, pleading for forgiveness. The half-elf pauses his whipping for a moment,

> *"Oh, you thought it was a matter of forgiveness? No, your suffering is merely your due, and it will continue so long as you draw breath!"*

The abuse continues and the sobbing and the weeping from the young male chained to the floor eventually fades. The abuser doesn't stop and a bigger grin falls across his face as he watches the boy release a final breath. 

The half elf leaves the corpse in the dismal shed and walks out, slamming to door.
