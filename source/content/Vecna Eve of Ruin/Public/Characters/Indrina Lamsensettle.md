Indrina Lamsensettle is an actor who moves within Neverwinter's highest social circles. When the players find her, her usual haughty demeanour has diminished with her imprisonment, though she's determined to make the cult pay once she escapes. She doesn't know anything about [[Vecna]] or the cult surrounding him. But she's strangely shifty around the players after Varin mentions that Lord Neverember is the one who sent for her rescue.

## Indrina's Secret 
Indrina collected information from skilled genealogists and assembled proof that [[Lord Neverember]] isn’t descended from Neverwinter’s great hero, Lord Nasher Alagondar, as he claims. Indrina assumes Lord Neverember wants to silence her for what she’s discovered.
