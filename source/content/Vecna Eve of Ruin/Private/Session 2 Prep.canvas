Gaunt-faced, thin limbed, and pale complexion, he sniffles in frustration about being bullied. He sits on the ground poking at the mangled charred corpse of an unidentifiable animal. He grins when corpse gushes a bit more blood.

He stands in a darkened shed, standing over a cowering figure. The young man is holding a lash made of fire and he kicks and whips at a similarly aged young man on who is bound on the ground, a sneering smile on his face.\n\n> *\"You thought I was weak, but you were wrong! You are the weak one! You thought you could say those things about my mother and it would go unpunished? You are a swine unfit to utter her name!\"*\n\nThe bound teen whimpers, pleading for forgiveness. The half-elf pauses his whipping for a moment,\n\n> *\"Oh, you thought it was a matter of forgiveness? No, your suffering is merely your due, and it will continue so long as you draw breath!\"*\n\nThe abuse continues and the sobbing and the weeping from the young male chained to the floor eventually fades. The abuser doesn't stop and a bigger grin falls across his face as he watches the boy release a final breath. \n\nThe half elf leaves the corpse in the dismal shed and walks out, slamming to door."},

The snake like creature looks into the sky and opens its mouth. Its eyes turn a undead green and a massive beam of energy shoots out of the serpents mouth into the skies.
