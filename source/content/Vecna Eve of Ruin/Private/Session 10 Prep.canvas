Once the characters\nenter his house, a group of three individuals\nin matching black uniforms congregate in the\nstreets. These are Daggers, Kas’s enforcers.

How or why\nyou came to this dreadful place, I know not. This\ncity is called Tor Gorak.\n\n• Who were those fighters?\nThose were the Daggers, they work for Tejen, the Darklord\nKas’s general.\n\n• Who is Tejen? \nTejen the Grim is the cruel commander of the Daggers. He operates out of the Fortress of Kas. He comes to Tor Gorak to conscript soldiers for Kas’s armies. Soon, I fear\nTejen will come for my children Hina and Eurik. The children should be returning from the rations distribution any minute.\n\n• Who is Kas? \nKas is the Darklord of Tovag. He is a vampire with a violent feud against an even more evil master he used to serve, and he uses his armies to seek vengeance.\n\n• How can we escape Tovag? \nI don’t know, but the Sleeper may. I can take you to see him if you promise to take my children away from this place before they are conscripted. If the party agrees to help Deurant’s children escape Tovag, he leads them to the Sleeper (the alias of Vocar) as soon as they are ready.

If the characters used the\npassphrase to get through the door to F7, Tejen\nwas not expecting them and says:\n\n> *“How did you get in here?” he says as he raises an*\n> *enormous mace. “Leave one alive for questioning. Kill*\n> *the rest.”*\n\nIf the characters used means other than the\npassphrase to open the door to F7, Tejen is aware\nof their arrival and the two Daggers are hiding at\nthe start of combat.\n\nDevelopment. \nAs Tejen is defeated, Vocar the Obedient, and Deurant (spy) enter the room. Vocar calls out to Tejen to gloat.\n\n> *“Here I am, Tejen the Grim. Now pray tell, where is*\n> *your grave master? I understand he is not here to save*\n> *you.” Vocar turns to you. “You are truly inspired in your*\n> *work. Vecna will be pleased we’ve dispatched his foes.*\n> *Now let us take control of this wretched place for our*\n> *master’s designs. The people of Tovag will serve him*\n> *well.”*\n\n> *Deurant looks at Vocar with surprise. “Vecna?” he*\n> *gasps.*\n\n> *“Silence,” commands Vocar, as Deurant’s eyes turn*\n> *purple and his expression turns stoic.*\n\nThe party should realize that Vocar is an agent\nof Vecna. If they respond by playing along, they\nmust succeed on a DC 16 Charisma (Deception) check. \n\nOn a failure, or if the party otherwise\nreveals themselves to be opposed to Vecna, Vocar\nis surprised because they bear Vecna’s Link, but is\nhappy to destroy them for his dark god. Deurant is\nunder the effects of a Dominate Person spell and\nfights alongside Vocar until the spell ends.\nSecrets. If they did not already learn Vocar’s\nand J’gal’s secrets the party should now learn\nthat Vocar is an agent of Vecna and Kas is\nmysteriously absent from Tovag. Regardless of the\ncharacters’ reaction to these revelations, learning\nthem each counts as a secret for the purposes of\nthe Power of Secrets rules in the introduction of\nVecna: Eve of Ruin.\n\nTransplanar Nexus. A creature standing inside\nthe transplanar nexus can use an action to make a\nDC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to activate the\nnexus. On a success, the runes begin to light up\nand after 1 minute, the creature can use an action\nto cast the Plane Shift spell from the nexus. Once\nused this way, the nexus cannot be used again\nuntil the next day at dawn.\n\nTreasure. If the party didn’t acquire the piece\nof the Rod of Seven Parts in Barovia, Tejen has it\nhere and uses it to control the Mists through the\nmap.\n\n# Sword of Kas\n\n> *Floating on Pedestal behind the Transplanar Nexus is a black Longsword with red crystals embossed on its handle.*\n> \n> *Beneath the sword is a rolled up piece of paper*\n\nThe sword is the Sword of Kas and the scroll is a scroll of True Ressurection\n","x":4400,"y":5560,"width":500,"height":2360},
