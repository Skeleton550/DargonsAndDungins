Neon is a secretive Lathander Cleric that helped the players rescue the prisoners from the Vecnan cult. He claims to have shut down the rising Ashmadai cult of Asmodeus in [[Neverwinter]] by passing on information to the town guard. Remembering Neon, the guard decide to hire him for the operation to rescue the 4 kidnapped citizens. 

Before getting banished into the Shadowfell [[Vecna]] insulted each of the players but none of his insults fit Neon's description.

After being banished into the Shadowfell, [[Varin Thorne|Varin]] confronted Neon and told him to tell the party who he really was. Turns out he was a Warlock who had lied about being a Lathander Cleric. Furthermore he dismissed his disguise and a dark blue skinned tiefling with ram style horns and religious ornaments decorating his body and clothes was revealed.
