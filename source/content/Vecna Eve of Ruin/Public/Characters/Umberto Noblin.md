Umberto Noblin is a Gnome Historian who has written books on various Deities and is eager to escape the place he has been trapped in.

> *"It is about bloody time someone came to my rescue! The food in this hellhole is quite honestly revolting!"*

To keep his mind off his imprisonment, Umberto spends most of his time after the players find him, complaining about the food. [[Bartholamew the Spiritual]] gave him his ration that he cooked up this morning as a gesture of good will and Umberto gladly accepted it. He thanked Bartholamew and called his food *"Divine"*

## Umberto's Secret
After Rix persuades Umberto to tell the players why he got captured he tells the players that he knows that the cultists of [[Vecna]] are his kidnappers, as he's one of Neverwinter's preeminent experts on Vecna's history.

After disclosing his secret, Umberto could not stop talking about his research on Vecna, further explaining to the players the ancient rivalry between Vecna and Kas.
