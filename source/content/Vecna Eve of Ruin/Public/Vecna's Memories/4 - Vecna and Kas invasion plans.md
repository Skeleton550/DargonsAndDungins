The players wake up alive and intact in a small patio area outside of someone's house. You here laughing and discussions nearby

Heading in the direction you come across two young men, one of which you recognise from the from previous dreams. There sat at a table with exotic foods and delicacies with some tea. On the table are papers. The men look right through you when you appear and don't even seem to see you.

The papers contain destruction plans for the entirety of a region that you don't know of.

The blonde half elf carries on speaking

> *" Oerth should be the least of our worries when it comes to shaping the universe in our vision. We know this place like no other. All that remains is for us to kill any traitors and betrayers"*

At this point the 2 men stand up and begin walking away before suddenly stopping. Their bodies don't turn around to face the players but their head snap backwards looking in their direction.
